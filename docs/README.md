* **Resource Management**: Resources from a provider are managed in Guardian's database. There is also an API to update resource's metadata to add additional information.
* **Appeal-based access**: Users are expected to create an appeal for accessing data from registered providers. The appeal will get reviewed by the configured approvers before it gives the access to the user.
* **Configurable approval flow**: Approval flow configures what are needed for an appeal to get approved and who are eligible to approve/reject. It can be configured and linked to a provider so that every appeal created to their resources will follow the procedure in order to get approved.
